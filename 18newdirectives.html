<!--
Create new Directives
- New directives are created by using the .directive function.
-When naming a directive, you must use a camel case name, w3TestDirective, but when invoking it, you must use - separated name, w3-test-directive:
-By adding a restrict property with the value "A", the directive can only be invoked by attributes:
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.9/angular.min.js"></script>

    <body ng-app="myApp">
        <test-directive></test-directive>
        
        <script>
            var app = angular.module("myApp", []);

            app.directive("TestDirective", function(){
                return {
                    restrict: "A",
                    template: "<h1>New Directive</h1>"
                };
            });
        </script>
    </body>
</html>

<!--  
    The legal restrict values are:

E for Element name
A for Attribute
C for Class
M for Comment
By default the value is EA, meaning that both Element names and attribute names can invoke the directive.
