<!--
Know Your Scope
- It is important to know which scope you are dealing with, at any time.
-When dealing with the ng-repeat directive, each repetition has access to the current repetition object:

<html>
    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.9/angular.min.js"></script>

    <body>
        <div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="myCtrl">
            <ul>
                <li ng-repeat="x in names">
                    {{ x }}
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <script>
            var app = angular.module("myApp", []);

            app.controller("myCtrl", function($scope){
                $scope.names = ["Email", "Tobias", "Linus"];
            });
        </script>
        <p>The variable "x" has a different value for each repetition, proving that each repetition has its own scope.</p>
    </body>
</html>
<!-- 
    Each <li> element has access to the current repetition object, in this case a string, which is referred to by using x.
