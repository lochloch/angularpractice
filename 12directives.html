<!--Adding Directives
AngularJS has a set of built-in directives which you can use to add functionality to your application.
- In addition you can use the module to add your own directives to your applications:
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.9/angular.min.js"></script>

    <body>
        <div ng-app="myApp" test-directive>

        </div>

        <script>
            var app = angular.module("myApp", []);

            app.directive("testDirective", function(){
                return {
                    template: "I was made in directive constructor!"
                };
            });
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
