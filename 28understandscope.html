<!--
    Understanding the Scope
- If we consider an AngularJS application to consist of:
View, which is the HTML.
Model, which is the data available for the current view.
Controller, which is the JavaScript function that makes/changes/removes/controls the data.
- Then the scope is the Model.
- The scope is a JavaScript object with properties and methods, which are available for both the view and the controller.
