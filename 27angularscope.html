<!--
AngularJS Scope
- The scope is the binding part between the HTML (view) and the JavaScript (controller).
- The scope is an object with the available properties and methods.
- The scope is available for both the view and the controller.
-When you make a controller in AngularJS, you pass the $scope object as an argument:
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.9/angular.min.js"></script>

    <body>
        <div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="myCtrl">
            <h1> {{ carName }} </h1>
        </div>

        <script>
            var app = angular.module("myApp", []);

             app.controller("myCtrl", function($scope){
                 $scope.carName = "Volvo";
             });
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
<!--  
    -When adding properties to the $scope object in the controller, the view (HTML) gets access to these properties.

    -In the view, you do not use the prefix $scope, you just refer to a property name, like {{carname}}.
