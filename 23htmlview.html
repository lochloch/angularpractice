<!--
HTML View
- The HTML container where the AngularJS application is displayed, is called the view.
-The view has access to the model, and there are several ways of displaying model data in the view.
- You can use the ng-bind directive, which will bind the innerHTML of the element to the specified model property:
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <script src = "https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.6.9/angular.min.js"></script>

    <body>
        <div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="myCtrl">
            <p ng-bind="firstName"></p>
            <p>LastName: {{ lastName }}</p>
            <input ng-model="firstName">
            <!-- Use the ng-model directive to bind data from the model to the view on HTML controls (input, select, textarea)-->
            <h1> {{ firstName }} </h1>
            <!-- The ng-model directive provides a two-way binding between the model and the view. -->
        </div>

        <script>
            var app = angular.module("myApp", []);

            app.controller("myCtrl", function($scope){
                $scope.firstName = "John";
                $scope.lastName = "Doe";
            });
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
