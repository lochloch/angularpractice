<!--
- An AngularJS module defines an application.
- The module is a container for the different parts of an application.
- The module is a container for the application controllers.
- Controllers always belong to a module.
- A module is created by using the AngularJS function angular.module
Add a controller to your application, and refer to the controller with the ng-controller directive:

-->

<div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="myCtrl">
    <p>{{ firstName + " " + lastName }}</p>
</div>
<script>
    var app = angular.module("myApp", []);

    app.controller("myCtrl", function($scope){
        $scope.firstName = 'John';
        $scope.lastName = 'Doe';
    });
</script>
